# Auto-Ingame-Resolution
A lightweight Windows tray utility that automatically changes the screen resolution when a specific game starts and restores the previous resolution when the game exits.  The program monitors process start/stop events using WMI instead of polling, reducing CPU usage and improving responsiveness.
